Design a high-conversion "Free Mint" Frame (Farcaster Mini App style 2025).

Product / NFT collection name: ……………………………………
Hook reason: limited time / gas cheap / community reward / airdrop claim

Structure:
- Hero image prompt: eye-catching artwork + countdown timer or "FREE" badge
- Main text: "Mint now – 0 ETH + gas only • 24h left"
- Buttons:
  1. Primary: "Mint Free"
  2. Secondary: "Preview Art" or "Why free?"
  3. (optional) "Check Eligibility"

After tap "Mint Free":
- Transaction simulation or success screen

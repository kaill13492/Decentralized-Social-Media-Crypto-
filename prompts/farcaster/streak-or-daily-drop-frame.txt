Create a viral "daily streak" or "claim drop" Frame (growth loop style).

Concept: users come back every 24h to claim points / tokens / badge

Features:
- Check FID → show current streak
- Button: "Claim Today" (disabled if already claimed)
- After claim: +1 streak, new total, fun animation prompt
- Motivator: "Streak 7 → unlock secret drop"

Image ideas:
- Progress bar or calendar heatmap
- Reward teaser for higher streaks

Buttons flow: "Claim" → "Share Streak" → "Back to Feed"

Return step-by-step Frame states + image prompts.

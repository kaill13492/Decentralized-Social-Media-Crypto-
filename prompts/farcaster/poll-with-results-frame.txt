Generate a poll Frame (classic but performant in 2025).

Question: ………………………………………………
Options: 3–4 choices (short & punchy)
Reveal style: show live results after vote (percent bars or numbers)

Extra twists that boost engagement:
- "Vote & recast to see results"
- Anonymous or tied to FID
- Optional: reward recasters with shoutout / future drop teaser

Image prompt: clean poll graphic with question as big text

Buttons: one per option + maybe "View Results" after vote

Return:
1. Initial Frame description
2. Post-vote Frame description
3. Image prompts for both states

Write a high-value LinkedIn post (800–1400 characters) in first-person voice.

Topic / lesson: …………………………………………………………
My role / perspective: ………………………………………………
Target readers: …………………………………………………………

Structure that usually performs best in 2025–2026:
1. Controversial / surprising opening sentence (1–2 lines)
2. Quick personal story or concrete example (3–6 lines)
3. 3–5 numbered / bulleted actionable insights
4. Vulnerable / honest reflection (what I still struggle with)
5. Non-salesy CTA: question / poll invitation / “drop your take below”

Tone: expert + human + slightly opinionated  
Emojis: max 4–6, strategic placement only  
No buzzword salad. Avoid: "game-changer", "revolutionary", "disrupt"

Return only the ready-to-copy post text.

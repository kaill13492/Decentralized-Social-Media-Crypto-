Create a minimal viable TODO app in Flutter (Dart) with:

- main screen showing list of tasks
- add new task (only title)
- toggle task done (checkbox)
- delete task (swipe or icon)
- local persistence (shared_preferences or hive – simplest option)

Requirements:
- clean code & good naming
- use Provider or Riverpod (pick the simpler one)
- Material 3
- minimal dependencies (ideally only Flutter SDK + 1 package)

Return complete code in separate blocks:
1. pubspec.yaml (only added dependencies)
2. main.dart
3. models/task.dart (if needed)
4. providers/task_provider.dart (if used)
5. screens/home_screen.dart

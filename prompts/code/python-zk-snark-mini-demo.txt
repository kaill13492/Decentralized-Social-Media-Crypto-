Create a minimal Python demo for ZK-SNARKs (using circomlib or similar – assume installed).

Goal: prove a simple statement privately (e.g., "I know X where hash(X) = Y" without revealing X)

Requirements:
- Use snarkjs or equivalent (note: for demo, use toy example)
- Steps: circuit definition, setup, prove, verify
- Clean code, comments
- Output: proof JSON + verification result

Return blocks:
1. requirements.txt additions
2. zk_demo.py (full script)
3. circuit.circom (if needed – simple one)

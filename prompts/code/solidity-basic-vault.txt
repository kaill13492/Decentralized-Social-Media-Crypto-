Write a simple Vault smart contract (Yearn-style) in Solidity 0.8.24:

Features:
- deposit(uint256 amount) – deposit ERC20
- withdraw(uint256 shares) – proportional withdrawal
- totalAssets() → uint256 – total managed assets
- pricePerShare() → uint256 – price per 1 share
- only owner can call harvest() (empty body for now)

Assumptions:
- single ERC20 asset (e.g. USDC)
- use OpenZeppelin IERC20 & Ownable
- standard Deposit / Withdraw events
- include nonReentrant guard

Return only the contract code + imports. No tests or deploy scripts.

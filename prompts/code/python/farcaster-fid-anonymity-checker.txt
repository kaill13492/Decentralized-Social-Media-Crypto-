Write Python script that estimates Farcaster user's onchain/privacy exposure.

Input: FID (integer) or @username
Uses public Neynar API or Warpcast public data (no auth needed for basics)

Checks:
- Number of casts last 30 days
- % casts with links / images / mentions
- Connected wallets (if visible via public casts)
- Follower/following ratio (doxx risk indicator)
- Simple score: 0–100 (higher = more exposed)

Output: friendly report + 3 quick privacy tips

Dependencies: requests, python-dotenv (for future API key)
Return full script + usage example.

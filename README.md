Decentralized Social Media (DeSoc)
Building Social Networks Owned by Users, Not Platforms
Overview

Decentralized Social Media (DeSoc) is a comprehensive research and product repository exploring how social networks can be rebuilt using blockchain, cryptography, and open protocols.

The project investigates how to move beyond Web2 platforms—where user data, content, and algorithms are controlled by centralized corporations—toward user-owned, censorship-resistant, and interoperable social media systems.

This repository is designed as a foundation for real-world implementation: from vision and theory, through tokenomics and architecture, to MVP and growth strategy.

Core Principles

User-owned identity (DID, wallets instead of accounts)

Content ownership (portable, censorship-resistant data)

Open social graph (no platform lock-in)

Transparent algorithms (or DAO-governed)

Creator-first monetization

Protocol over platform

What This Repository Contains

This repo includes 40 structured documents covering:

Conceptual foundations of decentralized social media

Analysis of existing protocols and projects (Lens, Farcaster, ATProto, ActivityPub)

Tokenomics and incentive mechanisms

Governance and moderation models

Technical architecture (smart contracts, storage, indexing)

Product strategy (MVP, growth, monetization)

It can serve as:

a blueprint for a DeSoc startup

a grant or DAO proposal foundation

a technical and economic reference for Web3 builders

How to Read This Repository

Recommended order:

docs/01_vision.md – Why decentralized social media matters

docs/02_problem_statement.md – What is broken in Web2 social

research/ – What already exists and what we can learn

tokenomics/ – How incentives and governance work

architecture/ – How to build the system

product/ – How to launch and scale

Each document is written to be standalone, but together they form a complete sy

Design Philosophy

Social media should be a public good, not a data-extraction machine.

DeSoc treats social networks as:

open protocols rather than closed platforms

digital commons governed by communities

economic networks where value flows to participants

Status

This repository is an active, evolving knowledge base.

Planned next steps:

full document completion (40/40)

optional smart contract prototypes

optional reference frontend architecture

optional whitepaper version
